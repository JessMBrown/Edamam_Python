Feel free to clone this project and see how I set it all up, this was my first python project on my path into tech.\
To achieve this I took part in the 
[ü©∑**Code First Girls**ü©∑](https://codefirstgirls.com/) Python kickstarter course, its free to sign up for and the mountain of experience I gained it was well worth the wait for a space on this amazing free course!

My Edamam project recieved ü©∑**Best in Class**ü©∑ an achievement I am very proud of especially as this is my very first python exposure to tech.

This was a really interesting project and i really enjoyed learning the fundamentals of python and the use of API's

Creating a functional app was a great achievement for me and I'm looking forward to developing my skills so i can expand on projects like this to combine multiple elements such as databases and a front end in future projects.
